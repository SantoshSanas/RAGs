We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses RunnableWithMessageHistory will continue to work as expected.Please see How to migrate to LangGraph Memory for more details.\\nOverview\\u200b\\nWe\\'ll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot.\\nThis chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions with a chat model.\\nNote that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation.\\nThere are several other related concepts that you may be looking for:\\n\\nConversational RAG: Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data\\nAgents: Build a chatbot that can take actions\\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the basics which will be helpful for those two more advanced topics, but feel free to skip directly to there should you choose.\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses Jupyter notebooks and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nFor this tutorial we will need langchain-core and langgraph. This guide requires langgraph >= 0.2.28.\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchain-core langgraph>0.2.27conda install langchain-core langgraph>0.2.27 -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nQuickstart\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably - select the one you want to use below!\\n\\nSelect chat model:OpenAI▾OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexitypip install -qU \"langchain[openai]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for OpenAI: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o-mini\", model_provider=\"openai\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain \"Runnables\", which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To just simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessagemodel.invoke([HumanMessage(content=\"Hi! I\\'m Bob\")])API Reference:HumanMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Hi Bob! How can I assist you today?\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 10, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 11, \\'total_tokens\\': 21, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-5211544f-da9f-4325-8b8e-b3d92b2fc71a-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 11, \\'output_tokens\\': 10, \\'total_tokens\\': 21, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\nThe model on its own does not have any concept of state. For example, if you ask a followup question:\\nmodel.invoke([HumanMessage(content=\"What\\'s my name?\")])\\nAIMessage(content=\"I\\'m sorry, but I don\\'t have access to personal information about users unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. How can I assist you today?\", additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 34, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 11, \\'total_tokens\\': 45, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-a2d13a18-7022-4784-b54f-f85c097d1075-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 11, \\'output_tokens\\': 34, \\'total_tokens\\': 45, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\nLet\\'s take a look at the example LangSmith trace\\nWe can see that it doesn\\'t take the previous conversation turn into context, and cannot answer the question.\\nThis makes for a terrible chatbot experience!\\nTo get around this, we need to pass the entire conversation history into the model. Let\\'s see what happens when we do that:\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessagemodel.invoke(    [        HumanMessage(content=\"Hi! I\\'m Bob\"),        AIMessage(content=\"Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\"),        HumanMessage(content=\"What\\'s my name?\"),    ])API Reference:AIMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Your name is Bob! How can I help you today, Bob?\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 14, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 33, \\'total_tokens\\': 47, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-34bcccb3-446e-42f2-b1de-52c09936c02c-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 33, \\'output_tokens\\': 14, \\'total_tokens\\': 47, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\nAnd now we can see that we get a good response!\\nThis is the basic idea underpinning a chatbot\\'s ability to interact conversationally.\\nSo how do we best implement this?\\nMessage persistence\\u200b\\nLangGraph implements a built-in persistence layer, making it ideal for chat applications that support multiple conversational turns.\\nWrapping our chat model in a minimal LangGraph application allows us to automatically persist the message history, simplifying the development of multi-turn applications.\\nLangGraph comes with a simple in-memory checkpointer, which we use below. See its documentation for more detail, including how to use different persistence backends (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaverfrom langgraph.graph import START, MessagesState, StateGraph# Define a new graphworkflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)# Define the function that calls the modeldef call_model(state: MessagesState):    response = model.invoke(state[\"messages\"])    return {\"messages\": response}# Define the (single) node in the graphworkflow.add_edge(START, \"model\")workflow.add_node(\"model\", call_model)# Add memorymemory = MemorySaver()app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)API Reference:MemorySaver | StateGraph\\nWe now need to create a config that we pass into the runnable every time. This config contains information that is not part of the input directly, but is still useful. In this case, we want to include a thread_id. This should look like:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc123\"}}\\nThis enables us to support multiple conversation threads with a single application, a common requirement when your application has multiple users.\\nWe can then invoke the application:\\nquery = \"Hi! I\\'m Bob.\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()  # output contains all messages in state\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Hi Bob! How can I assist you today?\\nquery = \"What\\'s my name?\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Your name is Bob! How can I help you today, Bob?\\nGreat! Our chatbot now remembers things about us. If we change the config to reference a different thread_id, we can see that it starts the conversation fresh.\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc234\"}}input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================I\\'m sorry, but I don\\'t have access to personal information about you unless you\\'ve shared it in this conversation. How can I assist you today?\\nHowever, we can always go back to the original conversation (since we are persisting it in a database)\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc123\"}}input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Your name is Bob. What would you like to discuss today?\\nThis is how we can support a chatbot having conversations with many users!\\ntipFor async support, update the call_model node to be an async function and use .ainvoke when invoking the application:# Async function for node:async def call_model(state: MessagesState):    response = await model.ainvoke(state[\"messages\"])    return {\"messages\": response}# Define graph as before:workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)workflow.add_edge(START, \"model\")workflow.add_node(\"model\", call_model)app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())# Async invocation:output = await app.ainvoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\nRight now, all we\\'ve done is add a simple persistence layer around the model. We can start to make the chatbot more complicated and personalized by adding in a prompt template.\\nPrompt templates\\u200b\\nPrompt Templates help to turn raw user information into a format that the LLM can work with. In this case, the raw user input is just a message, which we are passing to the LLM. Let\\'s now make that a bit more complicated. First, let\\'s add in a system message with some custom instructions (but still taking messages as input). Next, we\\'ll add in more input besides just the messages.\\nTo add in a system message, we will create a ChatPromptTemplate. We will utilize MessagesPlaceholder to pass all the messages in.\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholderprompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (            \"system\",            \"You talk like a pirate. Answer all questions to the best of your ability.\",        ),        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),    ])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate | MessagesPlaceholder\\nWe can now update our application to incorporate this template:\\nworkflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)def call_model(state: MessagesState):    prompt = prompt_template.invoke(state)    response = model.invoke(prompt)    return {\"messages\": response}workflow.add_edge(START, \"model\")workflow.add_node(\"model\", call_model)memory = MemorySaver()app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\nWe invoke the application in the same way:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc345\"}}query = \"Hi! I\\'m Jim.\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Ahoy there, Jim! What brings ye to these waters today? Be ye seekin\\' treasure, knowledge, or perhaps a good tale from the high seas? Arrr!\\nquery = \"What is my name?\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke({\"messages\": input_messages}, config)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Ye be called Jim, matey! A fine name fer a swashbuckler such as yerself! What else can I do fer ye? Arrr!\\nAwesome! Let\\'s now make our prompt a little bit more complicated. Let\\'s assume that the prompt template now looks something like this:\\nprompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (            \"system\",            \"You are a helpful assistant. Answer all questions to the best of your ability in {language}.\",        ),        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),    ])\\nNote that we have added a new language input to the prompt. Our application now has two parameters-- the input messages and language. We should update our application\\'s state to reflect this:\\nfrom typing import Sequencefrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessagefrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messagesfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDictclass State(TypedDict):    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]    language: strworkflow = StateGraph(state_schema=State)def call_model(state: State):    prompt = prompt_template.invoke(state)    response = model.invoke(prompt)    return {\"messages\": [response]}workflow.add_edge(START, \"model\")workflow.add_node(\"model\", call_model)memory = MemorySaver()app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)API Reference:BaseMessage | add_messages\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc456\"}}query = \"Hi! I\\'m Bob.\"language = \"Spanish\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke(    {\"messages\": input_messages, \"language\": language},    config,)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================¡Hola, Bob! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?\\nNote that the entire state is persisted, so we can omit parameters like language if no changes are desired:\\nquery = \"What is my name?\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke(    {\"messages\": input_messages},    config,)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Tu nombre es Bob. ¿Hay algo más en lo que pueda ayudarte?\\nTo help you understand what\\'s happening internally, check out this LangSmith trace.\\nManaging Conversation History\\u200b\\nOne important concept to understand when building chatbots is how to manage conversation history. If left unmanaged, the list of messages will grow unbounded and potentially overflow the context window of the LLM. Therefore, it is important to add a step that limits the size of the messages you are passing in.\\nImportantly, you will want to do this BEFORE the prompt template but AFTER you load previous messages from Message History.\\nWe can do this by adding a simple step in front of the prompt that modifies the messages key appropriately, and then wrap that new chain in the Message History class.\\nLangChain comes with a few built-in helpers for managing a list of messages. In this case we\\'ll use the trim_messages helper to reduce how many messages we\\'re sending to the model. The trimmer allows us to specify how many tokens we want to keep, along with other parameters like if we want to always keep the system message and whether to allow partial messages:\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, trim_messagestrimmer = trim_messages(    max_tokens=65,    strategy=\"last\",    token_counter=model,    include_system=True,    allow_partial=False,    start_on=\"human\",)messages = [    SystemMessage(content=\"you\\'re a good assistant\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"hi! I\\'m bob\"),    AIMessage(content=\"hi!\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"I like vanilla ice cream\"),    AIMessage(content=\"nice\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"whats 2 + 2\"),    AIMessage(content=\"4\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"thanks\"),    AIMessage(content=\"no problem!\"),    HumanMessage(content=\"having fun?\"),    AIMessage(content=\"yes!\"),]trimmer.invoke(messages)API Reference:SystemMessage | trim_messages\\n[SystemMessage(content=\"you\\'re a good assistant\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'whats 2 + 2\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content=\\'4\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'thanks\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content=\\'no problem!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'having fun?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content=\\'yes!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nTo  use it in our chain, we just need to run the trimmer before we pass the messages input to our prompt.\\nworkflow = StateGraph(state_schema=State)def call_model(state: State):    trimmed_messages = trimmer.invoke(state[\"messages\"])    prompt = prompt_template.invoke(        {\"messages\": trimmed_messages, \"language\": state[\"language\"]}    )    response = model.invoke(prompt)    return {\"messages\": [response]}workflow.add_edge(START, \"model\")workflow.add_node(\"model\", call_model)memory = MemorySaver()app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\nNow if we try asking the model our name, it won\\'t know it since we trimmed that part of the chat history:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc567\"}}query = \"What is my name?\"language = \"English\"input_messages = messages + [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke(    {\"messages\": input_messages, \"language\": language},    config,)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================I don\\'t know your name. You haven\\'t told me yet!\\nBut if we ask about information that is within the last few messages, it remembers:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc678\"}}query = \"What math problem did I ask?\"language = \"English\"input_messages = messages + [HumanMessage(query)]output = app.invoke(    {\"messages\": input_messages, \"language\": language},    config,)output[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================You asked what 2 + 2 equals.\\nIf you take a look at LangSmith, you can see exactly what is happening under the hood in the LangSmith trace.\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nNow we\\'ve got a functioning chatbot. However, one really important UX consideration for chatbot applications is streaming. LLMs can sometimes take a while to respond, and so in order to improve the user experience one thing that most applications do is stream back each token as it is generated. This allows the user to see progress.\\nIt\\'s actually super easy to do this!\\nBy default, .stream in our LangGraph application streams application steps-- in this case, the single step of the model response. Setting stream_mode=\"messages\" allows us to stream output tokens instead:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc789\"}}query = \"Hi I\\'m Todd, please tell me a joke.\"language = \"English\"input_messages = [HumanMessage(query)]for chunk, metadata in app.stream(    {\"messages\": input_messages, \"language\": language},    config,    stream_mode=\"messages\",):    if isinstance(chunk, AIMessage):  # Filter to just model responses        print(chunk.content, end=\"|\")\\n|Hi| Todd|!| Here|’s| a| joke| for| you|:|Why| don|’t| skeleton|s| fight| each| other|?|Because| they| don|’t| have| the| guts|!||\\nNext Steps\\u200b\\nNow that you understand the basics of how to create a chatbot in LangChain, some more advanced tutorials you may be interested in are:\\n\\nConversational RAG: Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data\\nAgents: Build a chatbot that can take actions\\n\\nIf you want to dive deeper on specifics, some things worth checking out are:\\n\\nStreaming: streaming is crucial for chat applications\\nHow to add message history: for a deeper dive into all things related to message history\\nHow to manage large message history: more techniques for managing a large chat history\\nLangGraph main docs: for more detail on building with LangGraph\\nEdit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templatesNextBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 2OverviewSetupJupyter NotebookInstallationLangSmithQuickstartMessage persistencePrompt templatesManaging Conversation HistoryStreamingNext StepsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')],\n",

(RAG) App: Part 2\\nIn many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\\nThis is the second part of a multi-part tutorial:\\n\\nPart 1 introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\\nPart 2 (this guide) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\\n\\nHere we focus on adding logic for incorporating historical messages. This involves the management of a chat history.\\nWe will cover two approaches:\\n\\nChains, in which we execute at most one retrieval step;\\nAgents, in which we give an LLM discretion to execute multiple retrieval steps.\\n\\nnoteThe methods presented here leverage tool-calling capabilities in modern chat models. See this page for a table of models supporting tool calling features.\\nFor the external knowledge source, we will use the same LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng from the Part 1 of the RAG tutorial.\\nSetup\\u200b\\nComponents\\u200b\\nWe will need to select three components from LangChain\\'s suite of integrations.\\n\\nSelect chat model:OpenAI▾OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexitypip install -qU \"langchain[openai]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for OpenAI: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelllm = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o-mini\", model_provider=\"openai\")\\n\\nSelect embeddings model:OpenAI▾OpenAIAzureGoogleAWSHuggingFaceOllamaCohereMistralAINomicNVIDIAVoyage AIIBM watsonxFakepip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for OpenAI: \")from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-3-large\")\\n\\nSelect vector store:In-memory▾In-memoryAstraDBChromaFAISSMilvusMongoDBPGVectorPineconeQdrantpip install -qU langchain-corefrom langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStorevector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(embeddings)\\nDependencies\\u200b\\nIn addition, we\\'ll use the following packages:\\n%%capture --no-stderr%pip install --upgrade --quiet langgraph langchain-community beautifulsoup4\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nNote that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"if not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"):    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nChains\\u200b\\nLet\\'s first revisit the vector store we built in Part 1, which indexes an LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng.\\nimport bs4from langchain import hubfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitterfrom typing_extensions import List, TypedDict# Load and chunk contents of the blogloader = WebBaseLoader(    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),    bs_kwargs=dict(        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(            class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\")        )    ),)docs = loader.load()text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)API Reference:hub | WebBaseLoader | Document | RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n# Index chunks_ = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\nIn the Part 1 of the RAG tutorial, we represented the user input, retrieved context, and generated answer as separate keys in the state. Conversational experiences can be naturally represented using a sequence of messages. In addition to messages from the user and assistant, retrieved documents and other artifacts can be incorporated into a message sequence via tool messages. This motivates us to represent the state of our RAG application using a sequence of messages. Specifically, we will have\\n\\nUser input as a HumanMessage;\\nVector store query as an AIMessage with tool calls;\\nRetrieved documents as a ToolMessage;\\nFinal response as a AIMessage.\\n\\nThis model for state is so versatile that LangGraph offers a built-in version for convenience:\\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraphgraph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)API Reference:StateGraph\\nLeveraging tool-calling to interact with a retrieval step has another benefit, which is that the query for the retrieval is generated by our model. This is especially important in a conversational setting, where user queries may require contextualization based on the chat history. For instance, consider the following exchange:\\n\\nHuman: \"What is Task Decomposition?\"\\nAI: \"Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable for an agent or model.\"\\nHuman: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"\\n\\nIn this scenario, a model could generate a query such as \"common approaches to task decomposition\". Tool-calling facilitates this naturally. As in the query analysis section of the RAG tutorial, this allows a model to rewrite user queries into more effective search queries. It also provides support for direct responses that do not involve a retrieval step (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from the user).\\nLet\\'s turn our retrieval step into a tool:\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")def retrieve(query: str):    \"\"\"Retrieve information related to a query.\"\"\"    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\n\" f\"Content: {doc.page_content}\")        for doc in retrieved_docs    )    return serialized, retrieved_docsAPI Reference:tool\\nSee this guide for more detail on creating tools.\\nOur graph will consist of three nodes:\\n\\nA node that fields the user input, either generating a query for the retriever or responding directly;\\nA node for the retriever tool that executes the retrieval step;\\nA node that generates the final response using the retrieved context.\\n\\nWe build them below. Note that we leverage another pre-built LangGraph component, ToolNode, that executes the tool and adds the result as a ToolMessage to the state.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessagefrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode# Step 1: Generate an AIMessage that may include a tool-call to be sent.def query_or_respond(state: MessagesState):    \"\"\"Generate tool call for retrieval or respond.\"\"\"    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([retrieve])    response = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])    # MessagesState appends messages to state instead of overwriting    return {\"messages\": [response]}# Step 2: Execute the retrieval.tools = ToolNode([retrieve])# Step 3: Generate a response using the retrieved content.def generate(state: MessagesState):    \"\"\"Generate answer.\"\"\"    # Get generated ToolMessages    recent_tool_messages = []    for message in reversed(state[\"messages\"]):        if message.type == \"tool\":            recent_tool_messages.append(message)        else:            break    tool_messages = recent_tool_messages[::-1]    # Format into prompt    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.content for doc in tool_messages)    system_message_content = (        \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \"        \"Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer \"        \"the question. If you don\\'t know the answer, say that you \"        \"don\\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the \"        \"answer concise.\"        \"\\\\n\\\\n\"        f\"{docs_content}\"    )    conversation_messages = [        message        for message in state[\"messages\"]        if message.type in (\"human\", \"system\")        or (message.type == \"ai\" and not message.tool_calls)    ]    prompt = [SystemMessage(system_message_content)] + conversation_messages    # Run    response = llm.invoke(prompt)    return {\"messages\": [response]}API Reference:SystemMessage | ToolNode\\nFinally, we compile our application into a single graph object. In this case, we are just connecting the steps into a sequence. We also allow the first query_or_respond step to \"short-circuit\" and respond directly to the user if it does not generate a tool call. This allows our application to support conversational experiences-- e.g., responding to generic greetings that may not require a retrieval step\\nfrom langgraph.graph import ENDfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_conditiongraph_builder.add_node(query_or_respond)graph_builder.add_node(tools)graph_builder.add_node(generate)graph_builder.set_entry_point(\"query_or_respond\")graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(    \"query_or_respond\",    tools_condition,    {END: END, \"tools\": \"tools\"},)graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"generate\")graph_builder.add_edge(\"generate\", END)graph = graph_builder.compile()API Reference:ToolNode | tools_condition\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, displaydisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\nLet\\'s test our application.\\nNote that it responds appropriately to messages that do not require an additional retrieval step:\\ninput_message = \"Hello\"for step in graph.stream(    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_message}]},    stream_mode=\"values\",):    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n================================\\x1b[1m Human Message \\x1b[0m=================================Hello==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Hello!

You can access that version of the documentation in the v0.2 docs.As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of LangGraph persistence to incorporate memory into new LangChain applications.If your code is already relying on RunnableWithMessageHistory or BaseChatMessageHistory, you do not need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses RunnableWithMessageHistory will continue to work as expected.Please see How to migrate to LangGraph Memory for more details.\\nIn production, the Q&A application will usually persist the chat history into a database, and be able to read and update it appropriately.\\nLangGraph implements a built-in persistence layer, making it ideal for chat applications that support multiple conversational turns.\\nTo manage multiple conversational turns and threads, all we have to do is specify a checkpointer when compiling our application. Because the nodes in our graph are appending messages to the state, we will retain a consistent chat history across invocations.\\nLangGraph comes with a simple in-memory checkpointer, which we use below. See its documentation for more detail, including how to use different persistence backends (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).\\nFor a detailed walkthrough of how to manage message history, head to the How to add message history (memory) guide.\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySavermemory = MemorySaver()graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)# Specify an ID for the threadconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc123\"}}API Reference:MemorySaver\\nWe can now invoke similar to before:\\ninput_message = \"What is Task Decomposition?\"for step in graph.stream(    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_message}]},    stream_mode=\"values\",    config=config,):    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n================================\\x1b[1m Human Message \\x1b[0m=================================What is Task Decomposition?==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Tool Calls:  retrieve (call_JZb6GLD812bW2mQsJ5EJQDnN) Call ID: call_JZb6GLD812bW2mQsJ5EJQDnN  Args:    query: Task Decomposition=================================\\x1b[1m Tool Message \\x1b[0m=================================Name: retrieveSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}Content: Fig. 1.

Using agents allows you to offload additional discretion over the retrieval process. Although their behavior is less predictable than the above \"chain\", they are able to execute multiple retrieval steps in service of a query, or iterate on a single search.\\nBelow we assemble a minimal RAG agent.

This approach enhances model performance by allowing for more thorough reasoning and planning. Task decomposition can be accomplished through various means, including:1. Simple prompting (e.g., asking for steps to achieve a goal).2. Task-specific instructions (e.g., asking for a story outline).3. Human inputs to guide the decomposition process.### Common Extensions of Task Decomposition Methods:1. **Tree of Thoughts**: This extension builds on CoT by not only decomposing the problem into thought steps but also generating multiple thoughts at each step, creating a tree structure. The search process can employ breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier or through majority voting.These extensions aim to enhance reasoning capabilities and improve the effectiveness of task decomposition in various contexts.\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nNext steps\\u200b\\nWe\\'ve covered the steps to build a basic conversational Q&A application:\\n\\nWe used chains to build a predictable application that generates at most one query per user input;\\nWe used agents to build an application that can iterate on a sequence of queries.\\n\\nTo explore different types of retrievers and retrieval strategies, visit the retrievers section of the how-to guides.\\nFor a detailed walkthrough of LangChain\\'s conversation memory abstractions, visit the How to add message history (memory) guide.\\nTo learn more about agents, check out the conceptual guide and LangGraph agent architectures page.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousBuild a ChatbotNextBuild an Extraction ChainSetupComponentsDependenciesLangSmithChainsStateful management of chat historyAgentsNext stepsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]]"

The main focus seems to be on developing LLM applications, using tools like chatbots, retrieval augmented generation, and integration with various data sources. So, putting this together, LangChain is a framework or library that helps developers create applications leveraging large language models and different components for things like data retrieval and processing. It provides tools and structures to build things like Q&A systems, chatbots, and more by integrating with vector databases and other services. The answer should be concise, so I'll highlight the key points: it's an open-source framework for developing LLM apps, offers components for chat models, retrieval systems, and has tools like RAG and integrations.\\n</think>\\n\\nLangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs).
