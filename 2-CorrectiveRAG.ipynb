    "# Corrective RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG (CRAG) is an advanced technique within RAG, that focuses on improving the accuracy and relevance of generated responses by incorporating mechanism for self-reflection and self-grading of retrieved documents. It does this by evaluating the quality of retrieved documents and applying corrective actions when necessary, such as refining or replacing incorrect retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the limitations of Basic RAG:\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems rely heavily on the accuracy of retrieved documents. If the retrieved information is flawed or incomplete, the generated response can also be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRAGs core components:\n",
    "1. Retrieval Evaluator: This component assesses the quality and relevance of retrieved documents.\n",
    "2. Generative Model: This model generates the initial response based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "3. Refinement and Corrections: CRAG employs strategies like knowledge refinementor web search to address issues identified by the retrieval evaluator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of CRAG:\n",
    "1. Improved Accuracy: By evaluating and corecting retrieved information, CRAG gelps ensure the accuracy of generated response.\n",
    "2. Enhanced relevance: CRAG can idintify anf filter out irrelevant information, making the generated response more relevant.\n",
    "3. Increased robustness: CRAG can handle cases where the initial retrieval process is not perfect, leading to a more robust RAG system.\n"

      "LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Based on the provided context, here's a concise overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts:\n",
      "1. **RAG Agents**: Combine retrieval from external data sources with LLM generation to answer queries accurately.  \n",
      "2. **Components**:  \n",
      "   - **Chat Models**: Use LLMs like OpenAI (e.g., `gpt-4.1`), Anthropic, or others.  \n",
      "   - **Embeddings Models**: Convert text into vectors (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, Ollama).  \n",
      "   - **Retrievers**: Search indexed documents (e.g., using vector stores).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Setup Steps:\n",
      "1. **Install Dependencies**:  \n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install langchain langchain-text-splitters langchain-community bs4\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "2. **LangSmith Integration** (for tracking/tracing):  \n",
      "   Set environment variables for logging traces:  \n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"\n",
      "   os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = \"your_api_key\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "3. **Indexing Workflow**:  \n",
      "   - Load documents → Split text → Store in a vector database (e.g., with `langchain-text-splitters`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Use Case:\n",
      "- **RAG Agent**: Dynamically searches a tool (e.g., a document index) to answer user questions.  \n",
      "- **RAG Chain**: A streamlined two-step process (retrieve → generate) for simpler queries.  \n",
      "\n",

       "'<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s tackle this. The user provided \"langchain\" as the initial question. That\\'s pretty vague. First, I need to understand what they\\'re really asking about. LangChain is a framework for developing applications with large language models, right? So maybe they want to know how to use it, best practices, or tutorials.\\n\\nBut the original query is just \"langchain\". That\\'s not helpful. The user might be looking for an overview, or maybe they want to know how to get started. Since the task is to formulate an improved question for web search, I should make it more specific. Adding keywords like \"tutorial\", \"guide\", or \"use cases\" could help. Also, considering common searches, people often look for how to use LangChain with specific models like GPT or how to build agents. Maybe the user is interested in integrating it with other tools or optimizing performance. \\n\\nI should also think about the intent. Are they a beginner, looking for resources to learn? Or are they encountering issues while implementing LangChain? The improved question should address the most probable needs. Phrases like \"how to use LangChain\" or \"LangChain best practices\" are better. Maybe \"What are the best practices for using LangChain with GPT-4?\" or \"How to build a LangChain application?\" But the user might not be that specific. Let me make sure the question is open-ended enough but still actionable. \\n\\nConsidering the user might not have technical details, the improved question should be general enough to cover different aspects. So perhaps \"What is LangChain and how can it be used effectively in AI applications?\" That covers the basics and invites a comprehensive answer. Alternatively, \"How do I get started with LangChain for developing LLM-powered applications?\" Both are good, but the first might be more inclusive. Let me go with the first one as it\\'s broader and could lead to more informative results.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Improved Web Search Question:**  \\n*\"How can LangChain be used to develop applications with large language models, and what are its key features?\"*  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\n1. **Adds context**: Clarifies that the user is interested in *LangChain* (a framework for LLM app development) and its practical application.  \\n2. **Specifies intent**: Focuses on *using LangChain* to build applications (vs. just a definition) and highlights interest in key features (e.g., modularity, integration with models like GPT).  \\n3. **Optimizes searchability**: Includes keywords like \"develop applications,\" \"large language models,\" and \"key features\" to align with common tutorial/blog titles and technical documentation.  \\n\\nThis version addresses the user’s likely deeper goal: understanding how to leverage LangChain effectively in their workflow.'"

Oh, the context is an empty list, so there\\'s no prior conversation history to reference. I need to answer based solely on the question.\\n\\nFirst, \"NLP\" stands for Natural Language Processing. The user is asking for an explanation of what NLP is. They might be someone new to the field or looking for a quick overview.\\n\\nI should define NLP clearly and concisely. Mention that it\\'s a subfield of AI, computer science, and linguistics. Explain its purpose: enabling computers to process and understand human language. Then list some key applications like machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, text summarization, and speech recognition. Conclude with its use cases in real-world scenarios such as virtual assistants, customer support, and data analysis.\\n\\nMake sure the answer is straightforward without technical jargon. Avoid using markdown and keep it natural. Check for clarity and helpfulness. Also, ensure the response is within the required length.\\n</think>\\n\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a meaningful way. It combines techniques from computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to process text or speech, performing tasks like **machine translation**, **sentiment analysis**, **chatbots**, **text summarization**, and **speech recognition**. NLP powers applications such as virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), customer service automation, and language-based data analysis.',\n",
